            The COVID-19 pandemic brought sudden disruptions to nearly every aspect of life, particularly the global economy. From stock market fluctuations to job losses, the crisis was deeply felt by households, businesses, and financial institutions. We’ll dive into these key indicators, showing how economic resilience began to unfold through data—this is more than just numbers; it's the story of recovery.

        <div class="caption">S&P 500 Stock Index (2014 - 2023)</div>
        <p>
            The S&P 500 chart is a reflection of the U.S. stock market’s performance, which serves as a barometer of overall economic health. The gradual rise until early 2020 showcases years of steady growth. However, the sharp decline in March 2020 indicates the economic shock caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. What followed was a sharp recovery, driven by government stimulus and investor confidence. This chart shows that despite setbacks, the market bounced back swiftly, suggesting a resilient economy.

        <div class="caption">Unemployment Rate by State in May 2020</div>
        <p>
            This chart highlights the unemployment rate across U.S. states in May 2020, a peak period of job losses due to the COVID-19 pandemic. States like Nevada, Hawaii, and Michigan, which rely on industries such as tourism and manufacturing, saw the highest unemployment rates. The data helps to illustrate how different regions were affected disproportionately by the economic fallout, with Nevada topping the list at over 20% unemployment.

    <!-- New York Unemployment vs. Labor Participation -->
    <section>
        <img src="images/NYchart.png" alt="Unemployment vs. Labor Participation in New York (2020)">
        <div class="caption">Unemployment vs. Labor Participation in New York (2020)</div>
        <p>
            In this chart, we see the relationship between unemployment and labor force participation in New York. As unemployment spiked in April 2020, labor force participation also took a dip, reflecting the significant loss of jobs and the reduction in available workforce. However, as unemployment gradually declined through the rest of 2020, participation rates steadily increased. This crossover indicates economic recovery, as more people returned to work, although full recovery was still in progress by late 2020.
